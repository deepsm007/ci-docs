description: An overview of the integration of Jira with the Openshift CI
---

Many automated processes exist to help you navigate the OpenShift Jira workflow when you're fixing a Jira bug with a
GitHub Pull Request. Read up on the overall process [here][1] before diving into the specifics of automation. There is
also a more general overview of the process in this [Google Doc][3].

## Linking Pull Requests to Jira bugs

In order to declare that your pull request will fix a Jira bug, the issue key must be added as a prefix to the pull
request title, like `OCPBUGS-123: Rest of the PR title`. To link multiple bugs to a single PR, list the bugs separated
by commas, like `OCPBUGS-123,OCPBUGS-124: Rest of the PR title`.

This will make the integration run a couple of validations. It will comment on GitHub with a detailed explanation of the
validations it ran and their result, so you can easily fix issues if needed. It will also add a label that indicates the
success of those validations to integrate with the merge automation.

To rerun the validations, comment `/jira refresh` on the PR. This is mostly useful if the Jira bug was changed.

All Openshift bugs must be made in the `OCPBUGS` project. For PRs referencing issues from other projects, a link will be
created but the rest of the lifecycle management will not be performed for the issue.

# The "verified" Label
Many repositories require the "verified" label on their PRs in order to merge. How this label is applied indicates
how testing has been or will be performed for the change being introduced. The `/verified` command allows you to 
apply the necessary label. There are two main variations indicating either pre-merge verification (i.e. testing
the changes before it merges) _has been_ performed or that post-merge verification _will be_ performed.

## Verified Command Examples
- `/verified by <a ginkgo test name>, @github_username` - Pull request will be labeled as pre-merge verified by the
  specified programmatic test and the named GitHub user. Issues with all pre-merge verified PRs will automatically be 
  moved to `VERIFIED`.
- `/verified later @github_username` - Pull request will be labeled as requiring post-merge verification by the
  named user. Issues with any post-merge verification PRs will be moved to `ON_QA` and must be manually moved to
  `VERIFIED` after testing.
- `/verified bypass` - Asserts that the pull request is non-functional and requires neither pre nor post-merge 
  verification. Bypassed verification is treated as being pre-merge verified (allowing issues to move into the
  `VERIFIED` state automatically).

## Pre-merge Verification
**Pre-merge verification is strongly encouraged** to ensure the smoothest workflow possible for QE and Jira
issues associated with the PR.

`/verified by <reason>` indicates pre-merge testing has been performed. The `reason` argument is a comma-delimited 
list of either:
- Programmatic unit, integration, or e2e test names or GitHub. Adding or updating tests alongside the changes being introduced
  is strongly encouraged as it helps prevents future regressions.
- `@username`s of the individuals who performed the testing. This should be limited to changes that are impractical
  to test programmatically. Engineers are free to name themselves if they performed approved QE testing against the change.

Jira issues associated with PRs that are pre-merge verified are automatically moved to the `VERIFIED` state after
their PRs merge. Pre-merge verification avoids the time sensitive necessity of a QE engineer manually testing a 
change after it merges and manually moving the issue to the `VERIFIED` state. It also avoids problematic scenarios
where an issue fails verification but has already merged into the product code base (which can interfere with 
production releases).

- Pre-merge verification is indicated by adding the `verified` label to the PR.
- If the contents of a PR change (i.e. a new commit is added), the `verified` label will be removed.
- If multiple PRs are linked to an issue, all associated PRs must be merged and labeled as pre-merged verified 
  for the issue to be automatically moved to `VERIFIED`.

## Post-merge Verification
If pre-merge verification is wholly impractical, `/verified later @username` indicates that _post-merge_ testing 
will be performed and by whom (a comma-delimited list of testers can be supplied). When post-merge verification is 
specified, the Jira issue associated with merged PRs will be moved into the `ON_QA` state. Component team members
will be responsible for manually changing the state from `ON_QA` to `VERIFIED` after testing has been performed.

- Post-merge verification is indicated by adding the `verified` AND `verified-later` label to the PR.
- If multiple PRs are linked to an issue, a single PR that requires post-merge verification will prevent the issue
  from being moved automatically to the `VERIFIED` state.

## Verification Bypass and Removal
- `/verified bypass` allows the engineer to assert that the change is non-functional and requires no testing. PRs
  which bypass testing will be treated as if they were pre-merge verified (allowing associated Jira issues to move
  into the `VERIFIED` state automatically).
- `/verified remove` removes the `verified` label so that it can be specified again later or otherwise corrected.

## Cherrypicking/Backporting

The Jira automation can also assist in the backporting process by integrating with the cherrypicking automation. To
trigger an automated cherrypick, make a comment on the PR in this format: `/cherrypick <<target-branch-name>>`. This
will result in the PR being cherrypicked onto `<<target-branch-name>>` after it merges and the new cherrypick PR will be
assigned to you. After an automated cherrypick is created for a Pull Request that references a Jira bug, the automation
will clone the original bug with the new target release and retitle the PR to correctly reference that new bug. The new
bug will also be marked as dependent on the original bug.

In order to backport a bugfix to more then one past release, it must be done serially (i.e. cherrypick from the
`current-release` to `current-release - 1`, then from `current-release - 1` to `current-release - 2`, and so on). This
is important because a bugfix must always been made in newer releases first, otherwise openshift cluster upgrades can
lead to running into already fixed bugs which should never happen.

When backporting to more than one release, users may specify all releases they which to backport to separated by spaces
in their comment. For instance, if a bugfix needs to be backported to `release-4.15`, `release-4.14`, and `release-4.13`,
the comment `/cherrypick release-4.15 release-4.14 release-4.13` can be made. When this is done, the automation will create
a cherrypick for the first listed branch and include the remaining branches in the description. Once the new cherrypick is merged,
the next branch will be handled the same and so on, without need for further cherrypcik comments to be manually made.

Another option for backporting is the `/jira backport` command. This is similar to the above command but will instead
create all of the backport issues immediately and then queue the cherrypick bot to create all specified cherrypick
branches after the PR is merged, instead of one by one. This can be useful for repositories with very long running
tests, as the tests for all backports will start immediately once the original PR is merged. These individual PRs must
still be merged in the correct order. To be able to merge PRs for older releases after the release above it has merged,
you will need to run `/jira refresh` on the PR to have the PR be marked as containing a valid issue. The format for the
backport command is slightly different than the `/cherrypick` command, as instead of using spaces, the branches must be
comma separated.  And example of a valid command is `/jira backport release-4.15,release-4.14,release-4.13`.

If the `/cherrypick` command fails to run correctly due to conflicts, the Jira automation can still be used to assist in
backporting. After manually creating the cherrypick PR, you can comment `/jira cherrypick OCPBUGS-XXX` to cherrypick a
bug and link it to the PR. The automation will clone the provided bug and link the clone to the PR by adding it to the
beginning of the PR's title. This command also supports cherrypicking multiple bugs (e.g.  `/jira cherrypick
OCPBUGS-123,OCPBUGS-124`).

## Non-bug Jira References

Some repos or projects may wish to require PRs to have a valid Jira reference but not follow the full `OCPBUGS`
lifecycle management and use their own Jira project instead. The Jira automation can handle this as well. The issue must
be added as a prefix to the PR title as with the usual `OCPBUGS` issues. For instance, `PROJECT-123: fix this issue`. In
these scenarios, the only validation that the Jira automation will perform is validating that the issue exists. If the
issue exists, the PR will receive a `jira/valid-ref` label. If the issue does not exist, the PR will receive a
`jira/invalid-ref` label. This allows teams to gate PR merges to require a Jira reference to merge by requiring a label
to exist or not exist. However, some PRs may not require a jira reference. To add the `jira/valid-ref` label to a PR
without requiring a Jira reference, users can use the `NO-ISSUE` or `NO-JIRA` title prefixes. For instance, `NO-ISSUE:
fix a typo`.

Note: While Jira references do not get validated in the same way as `OCPBUGS` issues, the automation will still check
whether the issue's `Target Version` matches what is expected for the branch. If it does not match, the PR will still
get the `jira/valid-ref` label, but the mismatch will be mentioned in the comment that the automation makes on the PR.

## Automatic Fix Version(s)

Another Jira automation that is part of the `release-controller` is the automatic setting of the `Fix Version(s)` field.
When a Jira issue lands in an `Accepted` nightly release, the automation will set the appropriate value for `Fix
Version(s)` to the issue and its parent Epic. It will also set the `Fix Version(s)` value to the parent Feature if every
Epic that is linked to the feature has had its `Fix Version(s)` field set. The value that is set will match the
`Major.Minor` version of the nightly that the issue is included in and the micro value will be `.0` if the release has
not become GA and `.z` if the release has become GA.

## Configuration

The configuration for the Jira integration can be found in the [openshift/release][0] repository.

Sample config overriding the `target_version` for the `release-4.6` branch of the openshift/ceph-csi repository:
{{< highlight yaml >}}
  orgs:
    openshift:
      validate_by_default: true
      # All bugs in all repos in the Openshift GitHub organization must have one of the following states, unless
      # a repo or branchconfiguration for valid_states exists.
      valid_states:
      - status: NEW
      - status: ASSIGNED
      - status: ON_DEV
      - status: POST
      repos:
        ceph-csi:
          # If we reference a bug in openshift/ceph-csi and that bug has a dependent_bug, it must be in one of the following
          # states.
          dependent_bug_states:
          - status: MODIFIED
          - status: VERIFIED
          branches:
            release-4.8:
              # Bugs for PRs that target the release-4.8 branch in the openshift/ceph-csi repo must have OCS 4.6.8
              # as target_version.
              target_version: OCS 4.6.8
              validate_by_default: true
{{< / highlight >}}
