{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
This document is intended for advanced users with specific use cases. Typical users should not need to trigger ProwJobs via REST.

The REST API has rate limits, and the username is recorded in the annotations for statistical purposes.

# Obtaining an Authentication Token

Each SSO user is entitled to obtain a personal authentication token. Tokens can be retrieved through the UI of the app.ci cluster at [OpenShift Console](https://console-openshift-console.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/). Alternatively, if the app.ci cluster context is already configured, you may execute:

```
oc whoami -t
```

# API Overview

There is currently no formal API specification available for this service because the API endpoints are dynamically transcoded and served using GRPC. This document outlines common use cases. For further extension and technical details, please refer to the GRPC API definition provided in the proto file available on GitHub: [gangway.proto](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/blob/main/pkg/gangway/gangway.proto).

# Common Use Cases

## Triggering a Periodic Job

The REST interface is most commonly used to trigger periodic jobs. For example:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -d '{"job_name": "periodic-to-trigger", "job_execution_type": "1"}' https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions
```

In this example, only two parameters are required: `job_name` and `job_execution_type`. For periodic jobs, the `job_execution_type` must always be set to `"1"`.

## Triggering a Periodic Job, override the payload

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -d '{"job_name": "periodic-to-trigger", "job_execution_type": "1", "pod_spec_options": {"envs":  {"RELEASE_IMAGE_LATEST": "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.18.8-x86_64"}}}' https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions
```

## Triggering a Postsubmit Job

Triggering a postsubmit job involves an additional requirement to define a `refs` structure. Below is an example `spec.json` file that must be created:

```
{
  "job_name": "branch-ci-openshift-assisted-installer-release-4.12-images",
  "job_execution_type": "2",
  "refs": {
    "base_link": "https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer/compare/bc8fd4d3f1f7...a336f38f75f9",
    "base_ref": "release-4.12",
    "base_sha": "7336f38f75f91a876313daacbfw97f25dfe21bbf",
    "org": "openshift",
    "repo": "assisted-installer",
    "repo_link": "https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer"
  }
}
```

For postsubmit jobs, the `job_execution_type` must be set to `"2"`. After saving the file, trigger the job by executing:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -d @spec.json https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions
```

## Triggering a Presubmit Job

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
While the REST interface supports triggering presubmit jobs, it is generally unnecessary. Presubmit jobs should be automatically executed or re-triggered using Prow commands (e.g., `/test` and `/retest`) via GitHub interactions.
{{< /alert >}}

## Overriding Job Environment Variables

To override multistage job environment variables, you need to enable overriding of a certain variable by adding the prefix `MULTISTAGE_PARAM_OVERRIDE_` to the variable name. You can then include the environment variable in the `pod_spec_options` field in your request. For example:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -d '{"job_name": "periodic-to-trigger", "job_execution_type": "1", "pod_spec_options": {"envs": {"MULTISTAGE_PARAM_OVERRIDE_FOO": "bar"}}}' https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions
```


## Querying Job Status

To query the status of a job, send a GET request:

```
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions/ca249d50-dee8-4424-a0a7-6dd9d5605267
```

A sample response might be:

```
{
  "id": "ca249d50-dee8-4424-a0a7-6dd9d5605267",
  "job_name": "",
  "job_type": "JOB_EXECUTION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED",
  "job_status": "SUCCESS",
  "gcs_path": ""
}
```

## Obtaining a Permanent Token for Automation

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Permanent tokens for automation are issued only in exceptional cases. All requests must be discussed in advance in the `#forum-ocp-testplatform` Slack channel. The requesting team will own the token and its associated responsibilities.
{{< /alert >}}

To obtain a permanent token for automation, follow these steps:

1. Create a rover group and add the designated token owners. Choose a descriptive, unique group name to avoid namespace collisions on the cluster.
2. Clone the `openshift/release` repository from GitHub.
3. Generate the token, from the repository root, run: 
   ```shell
   ./hack/gangway_token.py --group your-group-name
   ```
4. Submit a pull request with your changes.
5. Extract the token once your PR is merged: 
   ```shell
   oc -n your-group-name extract secret/api-token-secret --to=- --keys=token
   ```
   > **Note:** It may take up to 48 hours for the token to become available.

# External Client Tool

Test Platform recommends [Gangway CLI](https://github.com/openshift-eng/gangway-cli) as a reliable client for running periodics. It is especially useful if you need to modify job environment variables or specify additional execution options.
